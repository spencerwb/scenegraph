I don't know what the copy constructor, operator=, or the destructor
is supposed to be doing exactly.

I also don't know if I can use the assignment operator on Drawable
and glm::vec3 or ::mat3. Is it a deep copy or shallow copy or copy
of the pointer? Right now it just does the same thing as the copy
constructor. Also, for initialization lists, does it use the
assignment operator to assign values to data members?
